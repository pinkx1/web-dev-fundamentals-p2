  <h1>My Hobby: Video Games</h1>
  <p>I love playing video games. My favorite games include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dota 2 (Support player, 6500 MMR)</li>
    <li>Hearthstone (Battlegrounds)</li>
    <li>AAA Games: The Witcher, Skyrim, Cyberpunk</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I Love Gaming</h2>
  <p>Gaming isn't just a hobby for me; it's a way to explore new worlds, take on challenges, and enjoy unique experiences. Some of the reasons I love gaming:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  <strong>Teamwork and Strategy:</strong> Supporting my team in Dota 2, where every match requires not just strategic thinking but also significant psychological effort. Communication is key, and sometimes you need to find a unique approach to each teammate to keep the game on track and avoid potential disasters.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Immersive Stories:</strong> I deeply enjoy story-driven games with rich narratives, like Horizon Zero Dawn, The Witcher, and Skyrim. For me, playing such games is equivalent to watching a captivating series, but with the added depth of being closer to the main character and fully experiencing their emotions and struggles.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Achievement Hunting:</strong> Completing quests and collecting 100% achievements is a unique and fulfilling aspect of gaming for me. It’s not just a side activity—it’s one of my main goals. Finishing a game to perfection brings me immense satisfaction.
	</li>
  </ul>
